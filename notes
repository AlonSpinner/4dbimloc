THINGS TO WORK ON WHEN COMING BACK FROM THE EXCURSION:
a) BVH/KDTree for raycaster OR with culling objects outside frustrum #https://www.quora.com/How-do-modern-computer-games-render-fast-changing-high-variable-3D-environments-so-quickly-seamlessly
b) making the filter work with exact inverse (abandoning max(pz)) VEE.
c) throwing the filter into a numba wrapper
d) incorprating scan matching into the frame work
e) implementing adjustable particle numbers (KLD, follow ros amcl)  #recommended particle size 1000#
		--- what map do new particles get?
		
f) testing std(hit_normal, ray direction), for deviation of real world from BIM for particle weight.
g) creating a real-like construction site map to work simulate on
h) recording rgbd data from a real construction site that we can model
i) Additional Thoughts: layering the map with different overlapping options
j) Additional Thoughts: Adding Semantics! Will allow us to use semantic data from RGB that has no D.
k) Additional Thoughts: adding a "time" dimension to PF and search for correct time #where schedule comes in
l) Additional Thoughts: Autonmous agent!
m) Writing Writing Writing... god who has time for this.
n) wrapping the filter up and throwing it into a gazebo simulation?
o) Additional Thoughts: Importance Sampling so that each particle chooses its rays?
