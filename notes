THINGS TO WORK ON WHEN COMING BACK FROM THE EXCURSION:
a) BVH/KDTree for raycaster
b) making the filter work with exact inverse (abandoning max(pz))
c) throwing the filter into a numba wrapper
d) incorprating scan matching into the frame work
e) implementing adjustable particle numbers (KLD, follow ros amcl)  #recommended particle size 1000#
		--- what map do new particles get?
		
f) testing std(hit_normal, ray direction)
g) creating a real-like construction site map to work simulate on
h) recording rgbd data from a real construction site that we can model
i) Additional Thoughts: layering the map with different overlapping options
j) Additional Thoughts: Adding Semantics! Will allow us to use semantic data from RGB that has no D.
k) Additional Thoughts: adding a "time" dimension to PF and search for correct time #where schedule comes in
l) Writing Writing Writing... god who has time for this.
m) wrapping the filter up and throwing it into a gazebo simulation?
